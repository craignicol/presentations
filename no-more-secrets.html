# "No more secrets: how to secure modern webapps without sharing your keys" 

???
      
Craig Nicol is a technical architect at Screenmedia, and a developer with over 20 years experience in a variety of technologies, with a particular interest in interfaces and infrastructure, especially when they need to be secured.

(The mermaid diagrams need to be inserted as PNGs as there's a conflict between remarkjs and mermaid when there's multiple diagrams)

i.e. how does that backend know that I am me?

Cookies - Easily shared (Wiresheep), account accessed
- So we did HTTPS and noJS

Backend called API with a shared secret (on a good system - some just trusted the web servers). Users never saw it, all good.

Note that throughout this presentation, the sequence diagrams may be missing some steps so I can focus on the important details

NoJS no longer works.

Javascript is calling authenticated APIs within WebApps, and cookies don't cut it.

How to steal a cookie: 

* Wireshark : steal it in plain text (but please tell me your cookies are all HTTPS)
* XSS : steal it via Javascript on your machine (but please tell me your cookies are HTTP-only)
  * Assuming the data isn't available some other way (hello, local storage)

---

# Hello OAuth

* Separate identity onto its own service
  * Or a 3rd party service
* Delegate identity for finer-grained control
  * e.g. you can see my calendar but not my email
* Each application has a unique ID and secret
* Each application set of approved capabilities (scopes)

# The problem

Secrets aren't secret

* Put a shared secret in the Javascript, even obscured 
  * => you have no way to know who's using that secret
* Keep the shared secret on the server 
  * => you have no way to know who's calling your API, unless you can trust your cookie
* But what if your identity server is on another domain
  * => either an SSO solution, or a federated login?
  * => how do you share a secret without sharing your secrets?

.callout-image[🙊]

# The other problem

No. More. (3rd party) cookies.

🐶--(no login cookie for you)-->😈

(This breaks 3rd party identity providers on Safari today, Chrome shortly, and Firefox soon)

# Zero trust and the rules of network security

* We don't trust the network
  * Secret we receive has to pair with the secret we kept
* We don't trust the client
  * We can't hand out a shared secret
* We don't trust other servers, and neither do the browsers
  * We can't use 3rd party cookies

.callout-image[🙅‍♀️]

---
      
# The old way Vs new way

* No 3rd party cookies
* No refresh tokens
* No trust - verify everything

# Code sample

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
  auth: {
      clientId: "enter_client_id_for_😈",
      authority: "🌍.B2C",
      knownAuthorities: [],
      cloudDiscoveryMetadata: "",
  }, // !important - no secrets here
  // Put other behavioural settings here
}
const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);
msalInstance.loginSilent();
if (!loggedIn) {
  msalInstance.loginRedirect();
}
```
      
---
      
# New rules
      
* Keep key safe - no local storage
* In memory, use silent for refreshing. Cookie tied to login site, so can refresh via https, not XHR

# Summary

* The web ways of old aren't secure enough for SPAs
* The old OAuth path has some security holes
* The old OAuth path doesn't work with Safari or Chrome
* If you need login for your SPA, USE PKCE.
