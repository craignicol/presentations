# "No more secrets: how to secure modern webapps without sharing your keys" 

???
      
Craig Nicol is a technical architect at Screenmedia, and a developer with over 20 years experience in a variety of technologies, with a particular interest in interfaces and infrastructure, especially when they need to be secured.

# The requirement

Logging into the site and calling APIs securely

Cookies - Easily shared (Wiresheep), account accessed
- So we did HTTPS and noJS

Backend called API with a shared secret (on a good system - some just trusted the web servers). Users never saw it, all good.

Note that throughout this presentation, the sequence diagrams may be missing some steps so I can focus on the important details

# JavaScript is everywhere

    🐶->>🌍: Hello The Facebook!
    🌍->>🐶: Here's some code I wrote. Run it for me plz
    🐶->>💾: Let me like my friends cool band

</div>

???
      
NoJS no longer works.

Javascript is calling authenticated APIs within WebApps, and cookies don't cut it.

# The problem

Secrets aren't secret

* Put a shared secret in the Javascript, even obscured 
      => you have no way to know who's using that secret
* Keep the shared secret on the server 
      => you have no way to know who's calling your API, unless you can trust your cookie
* But what if your identity server is on another domain - either an SSO solution, or a federated login?
      => how do you share a secret without sharing your secrets?

# The other problem

No. More. (3rd party) cookies.

🐶--(no FB cookie for you)-->😈      
      
---
      
# Zero trust and the rules of network security

We don't trust the network - secret has to match secret
We don't trust the client - we can't hang out a shared secret
We can't use 3rd party cookies

# The old way Vs new way

No refresh tokens

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    Alice-)John: See you later!
</div>

---
      
# Code sample

```javascript
msal.loginSilent();
```
      
---
      
# New rules
      
Keep key safe - no local storage
In memory, use silent for refreshing. Cookie tied to login site, so can refresh via https
