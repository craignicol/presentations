# "No more secrets: how to secure modern webapps without sharing your keys" 

???
      
Craig Nicol is a technical architect at Screenmedia, and a developer with over 20 years experience in a variety of technologies, with a particular interest in interfaces and infrastructure, especially when they need to be secured.

# The requirement

Logging into the site and calling APIs securely
      
🕵️

???

i.e. how does that backend know that I am me?

Cookies - Easily shared (Wiresheep), account accessed
- So we did HTTPS and noJS

Backend called API with a shared secret (on a good system - some just trusted the web servers). Users never saw it, all good.

Note that throughout this presentation, the sequence diagrams may be missing some steps so I can focus on the important details

???
      
NoJS no longer works.

Javascript is calling authenticated APIs within WebApps, and cookies don't cut it.

# The problem

Secrets aren't secret

* Put a shared secret in the Javascript, even obscured 
  * => you have no way to know who's using that secret
* Keep the shared secret on the server 
  * => you have no way to know who's calling your API, unless you can trust your cookie
* But what if your identity server is on another domain - either an SSO solution, or a federated login?
  * => how do you share a secret without sharing your secrets?

---
      
# The other problem

No. More. (3rd party) cookies.

🐶--(no FB cookie for you)-->😈

(This breaks 3rd party identity providers on Safari today, Chrome shortly, and Firefox soon)
      
---
      
# Zero trust and the rules of network security

* We don't trust the network - secret has to match secret
* We don't trust the client - we can't hang out a shared secret
* We can't use 3rd party cookies

---
      
# The old way Vs new way

No refresh tokens

    🌍.B2C->>🐶: I know that callback URL. Here's an auth code. Do you trust 😈 ?
    🐶->>🌍.B2C: Sure, why not. Here's your auth code, and a code_verifier that matches the code_challenge I just gave you.

# Code sample

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
  auth: {
      clientId: "enter_client_id_for_😈",
      authority: "🌍.B2C",
      knownAuthorities: [],
      cloudDiscoveryMetadata: "",
  }, // !important - no secrets here
}
const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);
msalInstance.loginSilent();
```

# New rules
      
* Keep key safe - no local storage
* In memory, use silent for refreshing. Cookie tied to login site, so can refresh via https, not XHR
