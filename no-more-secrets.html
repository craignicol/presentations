# "No more secrets: how to secure modern webapps without sharing your keys" 

???
      
Craig Nicol is a technical architect at Screenmedia, and a developer with over 20 years experience in a variety of technologies, with a particular interest in interfaces and infrastructure, especially when they need to be secured.

--- 
      
# The requirement

Logging into the site

---
      
# The history

Cookies - Easily shared (Wiresheep), account accessed
- SO we did HTTPS and noJS

Backend called API with a shared secret (on a good system - some just trusted the web servers). Users never saw it, all good.

---
      
# JavaScript is everywhere

NoJS no longer works.

Javascript is calling authenticated APIs within WebApps, and cookies don't cut it.

---
      
# The problem

Secrets aren't secret

* Put a shared secret in the Javascript, even obscured => you have no way to know who's using that secret
* Keep the shared secret on the server => you have no way to know who's calling your API, unless you can trust your cookie
* But what if your identity server is on another domain - either an SSO solution, or a federated login?

---
      
# The other problem

No. More. (3rd party) cookies.

---
      
# Zero trust and the rules of network security

We don't trust the network - secret has to match secret
We don't trust the client - we can't hang out a shared secret
We can't use 3rd party cookies

---
      
# The old way Vs new way

No refresh tokens

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  a-->b: loginPlease
  b-->c: logged in?
  c-->a: no
  a-->c: loginPlease
```

---
      
# Code sample

```javascript
msal.loginSilent();
```
      
---
      
# New rules
      
Keep key safe - no local storage
In memory, use silent for refreshing. Cookie tied to login site, so can refresh via https
